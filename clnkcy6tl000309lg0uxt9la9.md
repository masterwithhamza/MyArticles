Python is a friendly and powerful programming language that's perfect for beginners. Whether you want to build websites, create games, or solve real-world problems, Python can help you get started. In this article, we'll introduce you to Python using easy words and simple examples, so you can begin your coding journey with confidence.

## **What is Python?**

Python is a high-level programming language that's known for its simplicity and readability. It was created in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum and has since become one of the most popular programming languages worldwide. Python is often used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.

## **Getting Started**

To start coding in Python, you'll need a few things:

1. **Python Interpreter**: This is like a translator for your code. It reads your Python instructions and tells the computer what to do. You can download Python for free from the official website ([python.org](http://python.org)).
    
2. **Text Editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**: You'll need a place to write your Python code. You can use a simple text editor like Notepad (on Windows) or TextEdit (on macOS), or you can use a more advanced IDE like Visual Studio Code or PyCharm.
    

## **Your First Python Program**

Let's write your very first Python program. Open your text editor or IDE and type the following:

```python
print("Hello, Python!")
```

Now, save the file with a ".py" extension, like "[hello.py](http://hello.py)." The ".py" tells the computer that this is a Python program. Next, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where you saved your "[hello.py](http://hello.py)" file.

## **Conclusion**

Python is a beginner-friendly programming language that's perfect for those new to coding. In this article, you've taken your first steps by writing a simple Python program and learning about variables and data types. Remember, practice is key, so keep experimenting and building to become a confident Python programmer. Happy coding!
